## Ingredients

- White Rice (cooked, preferably leftover)
- Black beans
- Onion
- Red Bell Pepper
- Minced Garlic
- Salsa Lisano<sup><a id="back-1" href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>
- Salt & Pepper
- Garlic Powder
- Cilantro

## Recipe

1. Add chopped onion, bell pepper and garlic to a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add a small amount of salsa lisano, to taste, once the veggies have softened
   some.
3. Add black beans and their liquid, then cook down until the black bean liquid
   has thickened some.
4. Add seasonings to taste and more salsa lisano. To 2 cups of beans, I would
   typically add 1/3 of a cup of salsa lisano, but that is up to personal
   preference.
5. Add rice to the pan. In my opinion, a good ratio of beans to rice is 2:3,
   but is really up to personal preference as well. 
6. Turn off the heat and mix in some cilantro.
7. Serve with eggs, avocado, and/or sausage
